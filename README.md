# GoFuel | EDX Bootcamp Project 1

## Description

As a driver I want to find the cheapest petrol station to save money in uncertain times. This web application makes it easy for people to review different options and identify the nearest fuel stations around them.

## Usage

Users input their US postal code, then they are provided with options of different fuel stations near in the proximity. Three API's were used in this application:

- NREL US Energy API to provide the fuel station data
- Mapbox to provide the mapping software
- Zipcodes to provide lat/long data to Mapbox depending on user postal code search
