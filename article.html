        How to save fuel in your car: money-saving tips for 2023
      </h1>
      <h3 class="heading">
        Rising petrol prices are hitting motorists hard, but these
        cinch-verified tips can help you reduce your car petrol bills - and
        improve your driving while you're at it
      </h3>

        <h3 class="heading">Drive more efficiently</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t worry, it’s not about driving at a snail’s pace – going slow
          can often mean lower gears and higher revs. Instead, simply driving
          smoothly is better for your fuel consumption.<br />

          <br />In fact, most cars return the best economy at around 45-55mph.
          Driving too fast or too slow on a road where it’s legal and safe to
          travel at a higher speed can be detrimental to fuel efficiency.<br />

          <br />Of course, it’s always best to drive at normal, legal speeds.
          But try to time gear changes to perfection, never rev madly to
          accelerate and avoid harsh braking by looking ahead and anticipating
          traffic conditions. See congestion ahead? Ease off the accelerator
          and slow naturally, rather than keeping the power on and braking
          close to the queue. Choose the highest gear you can as often as you
          can and take your foot off the accelerator as frequently as
          possible.<br />

        <h3 class="heading">Keep your car maintained</h3>
        <p>
          A car isn’t a living thing, so it won’t always tell you that
          something’s not right.<br />

          <br />For a car to operate as close to the peak of its efficiency as
          possible, it’ll need to be serviced by a reputable mechanic
          according to the manufacturer’s required schedule.<br />

          <br />Even tackling mechanical jobs like cleaning spark plugs and
          changing the engine oil can help fuel economy. Keeping on top of car
          maintenance in general will help your car perform at its best.<br />
        </p>

      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="heading">Consider the weight of fuel</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s one to ponder: you could save perhaps 1% of your fuel
          consumption by only half filling your car – because of the added
          weight of carrying a full tank of fuel.<br />

          <br />Of course, if you have to drive 20 miles to fill up that
          saving may be undone by cost of the extra miles. Nevertheless, it’s
          worth considering whether visiting twice as many times and half
          filling will save you money overall.<br />

          <br />Tracking your fuel costs and other car expenses is a good way
          to decide which changes will be most beneficial for you. Give it
          some trial and error until you see which tips suit your needs.<br />

          Does using the heating or aircon in my car use extra fuel?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sadly, cranking up the heat in your car does use extra fuel, so you
          may want to cut down on your usage if your aim is to increase your
          mpg.<br />

          <br />We don’t want to be one of those people, but layering up might
          be a better choice than reaching for the heated seat button if you
          really want to be efficient.<br />

          <br />Turning on your air-conditioning can also use more fuel, but
          opening a window can also increase drag on your vehicle and drive up
          your fuel consumption. You might want to experiment between the two
          and see which one offers a lower increase in fuel consumption.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="heading">Check your tyre pressures</h3>
        <p>
          Tyre pressure is easily one of the most common causes of poor fuel
          economy in cars. <br />

          <br />The wrong pressure in a car’s tyres can be unsafe, speed up
          the rate at which they wear – and it can make your car use too much
          fuel.<br />

          <br />Ever pedalled a bicycle with nearly flat tyres? It’s a right
          old workout. It’s the same thing when it comes to under-filled tyres
          on a car. Best to keep an eye on pressures with a proper gauge, and
          make sure they’re topped up correctly as per the car manufacturer’s
          handbook.<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="heading">Plan your route carefully</h3>
        <p>
          The most fuel-efficient roads aren’t slow city streets or quiet
          country roads – they’re motorways. They give the best chance of
          staying at a smooth constant speed in your highest gear, avoiding
          harsh braking and hard revving. It’s why satnavs often suggest using
          a motorway for a route even if it adds a few miles to the total
          journey.<br />

          <br />Also, consider that a warm engine is much more fuel-efficient
          than one starting from cold. This means that one longer combined
          journey is better for your pocket than lots of little ones.<br />
